Deep Learning Assignments and Projects

Three distinct datasets and their corresponding analyses are organized into separate branches. Each branch includes a dedicated data processing notebook, which is responsible for handling the respective dataset. Within these notebooks, the datasets undergo preprocessing, are converted into PyTorch tensors, and subsequently stored for further analysis. This structured approach ensures consistency, reproducibility, and efficiency in data management and model development.
